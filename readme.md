# Tum-Tum
## C++-like Preprocessor Directives for JavaScript

Tum-Tum allows for the use of a small set of preprocessor directives, much like those used in languages such as C, or C++.
The purpose of this is to allow for easier management of large-scale projects, and an easy to use (or not use) module system.
